Answers: -

1) B

2) D and possibly C if the brackets are corrected and were accidental.

3) A and B

4) A. If you see @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest, @SpringBootTest, etc. → Answer is @MockBean, else RARELY @Mock.

5) A and C

6) A and C

7) B and E probably but C alone not sure and could replace E, mosty @Spy isn't supported only @SpyBean is in springboot test directly.
   "Additionally, you can use @SpyBean to wrap any existing bean with a Mockito spy." says the official spring website, technically B and E answer.

8) D

9) A and C

10) B, C and E, but F also should work, not sure in Spring 5 as F option IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK PRACTICALLY.
    This beanName matching with field as fallback IS NOT APPLICABLE TO METHOD OR CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION BY DEFAULT.
    But in Spring 6 it MANDATORILY REQUIRES A -parameter flag when executing where in Spring 5 its unreliable so BCE is answer.

11) A

12) B

13) A (All conversions including UUID and many more supported)

14) A (authorizeRequests is used with antMatchers and is depreciated but usable but authorizeHttpRequests() is better with requestMatchers)

15) B,D and E. NOT A.

16) A and E

17) D

18) A and B

19) B and C	(Fun fact, AsyncRestTemplate (depreciated) and WebClient in spring-webflux dependency actually supports non blocking calls, as ASYNC != Non-blocking,

		async just blocks another thread instead of main thread thats all. that still 'blocks' that extra thread, non blocking blocks NO thread at all.)

20) D 		(its found in spring-test dependency, so not just boot, it works for core spring tests too)

21) C and D	(Reliable - Predictable, consistent, well-defined behavior, Interoperable - Works across platforms/languages using standard HTTP + JSON/XML.)
		Relative is NOT a meaningful option itself.

22) C

23) B, C and D (Cucumber is writing tests in plain English (Gherkin standard), PowerMock extenteds Mockito to do even static/constructor/final/private mocking)
	       (Ideally PowerMock shouldn't be used as it manipulates bytecode and is slow+complex and is last resort. EasyMock is OLDER alternative to Mockito)
	       (with functions like replay() etc, NOT standard now as Mockito is used. Hamcrest methods WORKS WELL with MockMvc but is STANDALONE actually)

24) A and B (AutoConfigureOrder isn't ideal or reliable to use so have to go with the other obvious options)

25) B and C (@Autowired fields are actually injected BEFORE any config methods are invoked ASSUMING CONFIG METHODS MEAN @PostConstruct.)

26) A and B (DANGER doubt, BASICALLY meant meta annotation on @XXX means IN THE @interface XXX {} the annotation SHOULD BE ON IT, DONT OVERTHINK THIS!!!)

27) B and D (BeanPostProcessor interface impls CAN be ordered using @Order(1) (highest priority is lowest number) on EACH IMPL CLASS)

28) B and E

29) A, B and F

30) C, D, and F (once second A looks convincing but NO WAY DEPENDENCY INJECTION IS CONSIDERED 'EASILY TRACEBLE')

31) A and B  (ONLY ONE @SpringBootApplication or @SpringBootConfiguration is allowed since it declares the entry configuration class)

32) D

33) D and E

34) A, B and D

    HttpServletRequest request can be injected IN method to .getMethod(), .getRequestURL() [full url with localhost] , .getRequestURI() [relative uri], etc as required.

36) D

37) A and E

38) A and B (YES, h2 hsql db and derby ALL INMEMORY DBs are RECREATED DURING STARTUP)

39) A (SPECIAL CASE WITH @Configuration or @XXConfiguration classes , in other cases target class is WRAPPED WITH PROXY CLASS,
	HERE THE CONFIG CLASS IS CGLIB SUBCLASSED and ALL BEAN METHODS ARE OVERRIDDEN TO ENSURE THEY CHECK CONTEXT BEFORE EXECUTION!!!)

40) B and D	(By classpath, it basically means all classes in working directorys, everything, and dependency jars etc)

41) C

42) B and D (@DataJpaTest isnt used for testing JdbcTemplate exactly, YES its available in it but ideal for @JdbcTest)

43) C and D

44) A and C

45) B

46) A

47) C

48) C and E

51) A and D

52) B and C

53) C and D

54) C and E.   (Only "Slice Tests" (like @DataJpaTest or @JdbcTest) are transactional by default, obviously c and e)

58) B

59) C

60) A and C   (Yes Spring Data GENERALLY has implementations for all DB types like Mongo, Neo4J, Redis etc.)

61) A

62) A and C (Technically even RestClientTest along with Repository and Web slice testing IS IN SPRING-BOOT-STARTER-TEST, but option says JUST "Client",
	     vague and NOT STANDARD ANYWAYS compared to the other 2, so finally A and C is answer)

75) A	(there is no spring-boot-starter-rest , only x-x-x-web)

76) A and B

77) D and E (A is wrong coz it says ONLY for controller method, but we know on class also we can use,
	     and option B wrong coz controller method annotated with this CAN RETURN VIEW but we don't MAP TO A VIEW, that doesn't even make sense)

78) B

79) D and E

80) A and D (Scans @ControllerAdvice, @ExceptionHandler, Filters, etc stuff required by default too, DOES NOT run a server, and boot ALREADY SUPPORTS Mockito by default) 
    Note: MockMvc is auto injected in @WebMvcTest but otherwise @AutoConfigureMockMvc on test class or MockMvcBuilder manually building obj is needed.

81) B and D

82) B and C

83) A and D

84) C and E

85) C and D  (can ONLY check equality of tags so NO thresholds, so A alone remained other than C and D, but headers ISN'T A PROPER NON-BUSINESS TAG SO IT's NOT BUILT IN
	      Thats why uri, method, status, exception, outcome [SUCCESS, CLIENT_ERROR, SERVER_ERROR, REDIRECTION, INFORMATIONAL)] ARE DEFAULT 5 tags.)

86) C and D  (Example: To get max orderDate, correct method name should be - findFirstByOrderByOrderDateDesc())

87) D		(@AfterThrowing can only throw to replacing currently thrown exception, CANT CATCH AND AVOID an exception)

88) B and D   (LUCKY GUESS, C and E options ARE DONE BY BeanPostProcessor, NOT Bean 'FACTORY' PostProcessor)

89) C and E  (DANGER, GOT IT WRONG! I thought @Value and @ConfigurationProperties each would have 1 correct option, DONT ASSUME THINGS!!! Several MISCONCEPTIONS :
		* BOTH ANNOTATIONS CAN ACCESS ENVIRONMENT
		* RELAXED BINDING MEANS FIELD AND ACTUAL PROPERTY NAME may not PERFECTLY MATCH IN CASE OR SEPERATING SYMBOLS,
		  so @ConfigurationProperties IS RELAXED BINDING to properties in terms of names
		* @Value HAS STRICT BINDING of properties to variables in terms of names)

90) A and D  (Wasnt sure, but logging dependency NOT needed to be added to use /actuator/loggers endpoint)







Stuff i got wrong or incorrect fairly or unfairly (ignoring trivia; bracket syntax stuff):
4 had doubt
5 had minor doubt but not much
6 had doubt but chose correct
7 (unclear and no idea)
10 just confusion , conceptually know but question correct?
11 minor doubt
15 confused by A option saying risk governance, B was the obvious answer
16 Correct. Just remember @ConditionalOnBean takes both name attribute and just also take (X.class) in its param.
18 Couldve chosen wrong but rest were so wrong so saved. I didnt know though @EnableTransactionManagement isnt needed if dependency is there in springBOOT,
   ITS NEEDED IN NORMAL 'SPRING'. Read the question carefully for boot / core spring. All @EnableXXX is needed explicitly for Spring. onyl boot some are not needed if dependency is there.
23 Had to guess 1 alone, if its Hamcrest/Cucumber/PowerMock. Somehow i chose Hamcrest, it exists along with Mockito, junit, spring-test, etc.
   is(),not(),equalTo(),allOf() (AND),anyOf() (OR),containsString(), startsWith(), equalToIgnoringCase(), hasSize(), hasItem(), containsInAnyOrder(), greaterThan(), closeTo(),hasProperty()
24 Explanation in learning text from line 2650 approx. @AutoConfigureOrder,XXBefore and XXAfter, all annotations i didnt know, a comment says this question was peculiar so ig its ok idk.
   Option E seems to be correct but not only the After and Before annotations are relative and more reliable, Order doesn't behave like relatively, so unreliable customization ig.
25 Got initially confufsed with option A, then it was clear config METHODS MEAN init-method/@PostContruct method etc, they run in next step after bean creation.
26 Didn't realise autoconfig 'guessing' beans required is true, and also other option is wrong as Autoconfig IS APPLIED AFTER EVERYONE ,critically speaking thats the only point confusing,
   But ALL autoconfigs should be created ONLY AFTER the app beans.
27 Forgot Initialization phase of bean includes the BeanPostProcessor processBeforeInitialization and vice versa.
28
30 Didnt get the meanings exactly of dependency injection theory text.
37 had minor doubts on nestedPropagation option
38 took time and doubted but correct. spring.jpa.packages-to-scan can customize jpa scanning and other than jpa, spring-data-jdbc and others are there as jpa alternatives.
39 NO MATTER EVEN IF BEAN CALLED BY METHOD NAME (like accountRepository()) inside another @Bean method or other place,
   If its INSIDE @Configuration class (or @SpringBootApplication/@XXConfiguration), cglib proxies are created and Bean method calls ARE INTERCEPTED TO CHECK IF OBJ EXISTS IN context.
   ONLY ONE IS ACTUALLY CREATED IF BEAN METHOD IS CALLED in this question due to the proxy intercepting @Bean method calls INSIDE config.
42 Option A seemed to be right, but TestEntityManager DOES NOT HAVE all methods as of EntityManager. TestEntityManager is a focused wrapper that only provides a subset of methods relevant 
   for testing (e.g., persist, flush, clear), making it safer for isolated tests than the full EntityManager API.
44 It's NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY AUTOCONFIGURATION IF CLASSES ARE PRESENT. They DIDNT EVEN SAY AUTOCONFIG HAS TO MAKE DUPLICATE BEAN AGAIN, it could make some other relevant bean too!
48 Almost had doubt if /info is exposed by default, NO ONLY /health is by default exposed unless management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bean,env,...etc property is set.
49 @TestPropertySource(properties = {"myapp.url=http://localhost:8080"}) is valid , and
   By default, @TestPropertySource loads files relative to the test class itself if no explicit file path is given. The file name defaults to "ThisTestClassName.properties".
51 Chose by luck but need to know so many indicators are autoconfigured IF respective libraries are attached (except DiskSpaceHealthIndicator and PingHealthIndicator which will always be 
   there as long as spring-boot-starter-actuator dep. is there).
52 Correct.  @SqlMergeMode(false): This controls whether method-level @Sql declarations should be merged with class-level @Sql declarations; nothing related to transaction.
53 No idea i had, /actuator/metrics is NOT A PARENT SUBURL, its a SIBLING URL o health, info, etc. , MEANING BY DEFAULT IT's NOT EXPOSED! Also, tags for metrics not compulsory.
57 Basically had correct thoughts in mind but got swayed wrongly. SQLException IS NOT THROWN, instead the RuntimeExceptions are. jdbcTemplate DOES PROVIDE ABILITY to work with ResultSet.
62 Felt like client etc had annotations for test, but safer option and examtopics say web and repository.
63 Correctly chose, but every option looked correct. Note that @BeforeAll SHOULD BE USED ONLY ON static METHODS! Also,
   By default, JUnit 5 uses @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_METHOD) on class basically (implicitly). In this mode, it is mandatory for @BeforeAll and @AfterAll methods to be static.
   .PER_CLASS means entire class runs in 1 lifecycle so static rule isn't mandatory. otherwise BeforeAll CANT run before all instances are created UNLESS IT's method is static.
71 NO Source code (.java) is included in ANY of the packaging, whether war or jar , whether .original or normal jar.
77 Correct. @RequestMapping can be used BOTH on class and method of @Controller class, so option A is wrong. And it supports ALL HTTP METHODS including HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.
80 MockMvc is available to be injected in @WebMvcTest and needed to test controllers WITHOUT STARTING A WEB SERVER IN REAL PORT AT ALL.
   While among other layers it only scans @Controller, BUT @XXConfigurer, @ControllerAdvice (can primarily have @ExceptionHandler methods for global handling), etc.
   
   NOTE: @Mock / @Spy requires @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) OR MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this) in @BeforeEach method, and Mockito.mock(Class.class) and @MockBean DOES NOT!!!]	 @MockBean isnt even mockito package, and needs nothing. Mockito.mock() works as a STANDARD METHOD CALL returning mock obj, therefore NOT NEEDING ANY EXTRA MOCKITO EXTENSION.

   AND YES, @WebMvcTest CREATES A MINI-APPLICATION CONTEXT, hence @MockBean IS NEEDED and typically used as the MockMvc is used.

85 NO IDEA WHAT THIS QUESTION MEANT. They meant each metric has tags to filter, and inbuilt tags for http.server.requests are : method,status,uri,exception,outcome (More metrics there too)
   Note: Tags CANT BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN EQUALITY CONDITIONs like ?status=200 etc, any options like > or < IS OBVIOUSLY WRONG.
88 Correct by process of elimination, but remember PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor
   BeanFactoryPostProcessor can help Overriding property values, Modifying bean metadata, registering new beans.
89 @ConfigurationProperties CAN ACCESS ENVIRONMENT, and it is MORE TYPESAFE THAN @Value in property binding.

const AI_REQUEST_TEXT = "So I need you to generate a list of ingredients where its like [(\"Basmati Rice\",500,\"g\"),(\"Ghee\",20,\"ml\"),(\"Condensed Milk\",50,\"g\"),(\"Cream\",30,\"ml\")] for the given recipe name and the required quantity I mention at the end of this query. As mentioned before, in the list each ingredient's 1st value in the (...) is the name of the ingredient. Ensure to not be too vague but also dont make the name too long and unsearchable in big basket website. And DO NOT INCLUDE WATER AS AN (...) ENTRY IN THIS ENTIRE LIST. Second entry in the (...) is basically magnitude of quantity required to be used for the recipe. Ensure to mention the correct quantity for the required final qty of food which I inform you at end of the response. And 3rd and final entry inside the (...) brackets is the unit of the magnitude of measurement I just mentioned. Ensure to always stick to the standard units like \"g\", \"kg\", \"L\", \"ml\", or maybe like \"mg\". But ALWAYS USE \"ml\" and \"L\" as units ONLY for pure liquids like Oil, Fresh Cream, Ghee (since its liquified), Vanilla essense, etc. LAST TIME YOU HAVE \"g\" for Fresh Cream, DONT DO THAT. DO NOT USE liquid units like these mentioned for semisolids like curd, condensed milk, etc. So please prefer \"g\" and \"kg\" unless very liquidy and probably if sells with \"g\" or \"kg\" mentioned not \"ml\" or \"L\". Give proper ingredients to make the dish i mention very well, ENSURE TO GIVE PROPER LIST OF what i call tuples. Please make sure you follow the list format I gave you VERY VERY STRICTLY, other than number of entries , the way the list is with double quotes used ONLY for 1st and 3rd values in each entry and the brackets used without unnecessary spaces and new lines ARE VERY IMPORTANT. Dont let me down. After you give the full list , well BELOW that list (NOT above the list that will be ignored, ensure NOT to use language which shows its ai generated, be natural like human) you can give instructions to do this recipe fully. AND DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER ADD ONs in the list of ingredient entries , like DONT include potatoes as ingredient in a burger if it is ONLY used for the add on which is french fries, THAT SHOULDNT COUNT. Same thing but once you gave Rice as ingredient FOR PANEER BUTTER MASALA, WHY? if you want to mention add ons, mention in the recipe information, NOT in the LIST which I strictly regulate to be used by application , only necessary ingredients with appropriate units as i mentioned before with EXACT FORMAT & NO UNNECESSARY spaces etc. And try NOT to put a bunch of ingredients into 1 entry like \"Spices Mix\" or some mix UNLESS thats how everyone does it and/or THAT IS A WIDELY recognised and UNIFORMly made mix that I CANT GO WRONG WITH (like it isnt vague and just saying it to shopkeeper I'll get the right one, then its fine, else put seperate ingredients). You once gave an entry before as (\"Salt\",to taste,\"g\") WHICH IS HORRIBLE FORMATTING, it expects integer inbetween you betrayed me. Ensure the format is STRICTLY FOLLOWED AT ANY COST (integer is at the middle value of each entry). :- \n";
